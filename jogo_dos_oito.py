"""

Solver script for the fifteen-puzzle and derivations of it (8-puzzle etc.),
based on what we've learnt on ai-class.com so far. Don't expect it to run very
fast, certain puzzle states take ages to solve. I have documented and
commented the code thoroughly, so hopefully it's easy to understand what's
going on.

Example usage:

    >>> from slidingpuzzle import Board
    >>> b = Board(3, "1,8,7,3,0,5,4,6,2")
    >>> print b
     1  8  7
     3     5
     4  6  2
    >>> b.get_solution()
    Solution found!
